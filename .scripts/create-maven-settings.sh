# Creates the Maven settings file for the CI process. Said file will be stored on
# the ~/settings.xml path, and its contents will be created from a series of
# environmental variables.
#
# The most important information it will contain will be the connection settings for all
# the repositories used during deployment.
#
# For security reasons the data stored in the generated file should not be shared. Never
# print it on the console or let it be accessed in any way.
#
# The following environmental variables are required by the script:
# - DEPLOY_USER: string, user for the releases repo
# - DEPLOY_PASSWORD: string, password for the releases repo
# - DEPLOY_DEVELOP_USER: string, user for the development repo
# - DEPLOY_DEVELOP_PASSWORD: string, password for the development repo
# - DEPLOY_DOCS_USER: string, user for the releases documentation site repo
# - DEPLOY_DOCS_PASSWORD: string, password for the releases documentation site repo
# - DEPLOY_DOCS_DEVELOP_USER: string, user for the development documentation site repo
# - DEPLOY_DOCS_DEVELOP_PASSWORD: string, password for the development documentation site repo
# - VERSION_TYPE: string, the type of version of the code. One of 'release', 'develop' or 'other'.
