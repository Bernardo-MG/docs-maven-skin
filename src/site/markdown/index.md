#Maven Site as a documentation site

While Maven offers a way to generate a project-related site, which is a great way to create the project's documentation, it is rarely used. That's not a surprise, as Maven skins are outdated and ugly.

The Docs Maven Skin aims to fix, mostly by updating the XHTML which Doxia creates to a modern and reactive HTML5 page, which makes use of libraries such as Boostrap and Font Awesome. This is combined into a minimalist look which won't distract from the site's actual use: documenting the project.

## Features

The main features offered by the skin are:

- Minimalist and reactive look
- HTML5
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome icons
